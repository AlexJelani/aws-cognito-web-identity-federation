# Environment Setup Guide

Based on the configuration update script and project documentation, follow these steps to set up your environment:

1. Create a new `.env` file by copying `.env.example`:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

2. Open the `.env` file and fill in your configuration values

3. Run the configuration update script:
```bash
node scripts/update-config.js
```

The `.env.example` file has been created with placeholder values for the following required environment variables:

- AWS_REGION: The AWS region where your resources are deployed
- IDENTITY_POOL_ID: Your AWS Cognito Identity Pool ID
- GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID: Your Google OAuth 2.0 Client ID
- PRIVATE_BUCKET_NAME: The name of your AWS S3 bucket for private storage

Important: Do not commit your `.env` file to version control as it may contain sensitive information.
