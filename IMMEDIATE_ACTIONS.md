   - Update the client ID in your application
   - Review OAuth consent screen settings

3. **S3 Bucket:**
   - Review bucket access logs for unauthorized access
   - Consider creating a new bucket with a different name
   - Ensure bucket policies are properly configured
   - Enable logging and monitoring

4. **Additional Steps:**
   - Review Git history and remove sensitive information
   - Consider using git-filter-repo to clean history
   - Enable branch protection rules
   - Set up pre-commit hooks to catch credentials
   - Review AWS CloudTrail logs for unauthorized actions

## Prevention
