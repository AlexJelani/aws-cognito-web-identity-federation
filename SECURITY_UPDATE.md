# Security Update: Configuration Management

The sensitive configuration values have been removed from the source code. To properly set up the application:

1. Create a `.env` file in the root directory (copy from `.env.example`)
2. Fill in your configuration values in the `.env` file
3. Run the configuration update script: `node scripts/update-config.js`

The `.env` file is already in `.gitignore` and will not be committed to the repository.

**Important**: 
- Rotate the exposed credentials immediately
- Update your Identity Pool configuration
- Update your Google OAuth client credentials
- Consider reviewing access logs for any unauthorized usage

For additional security, consider:
- Using AWS Secrets Manager for sensitive values
- Implementing IP restrictions on your Identity Pool
- Setting up monitoring for unusual access patterns
