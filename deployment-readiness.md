# Deployment Readiness Assessment

## Configuration Check
✅ All essential configurations are in place:
- Google Client ID is configured in app.js
- AWS region is set to us-east-1
- S3 bucket configurations are properly set
- Identity Pool ID is configured
- CloudFront distribution is properly set up

## Required Files Present
✅ All necessary files are available:
- Frontend files (HTML, JS, CSS)
- CDK stack configuration
- Package.json with correct dependencies

## Deployment Commands Available
The following npm scripts are properly configured in package.json:
```
"deploy": "npm run build && cdk deploy"
"post-deploy": "npm run deploy-frontend && npm run invalidate-cache && npm run update-config"
```

## Recommendation
The code is ready for deployment. You can proceed with deployment using:
```bash
npm run deploy
npm run post-deploy
```

This will:
1. Build and deploy the CDK stack
2. Deploy the frontend files to S3
3. Invalidate the CloudFront cache
4. Update the frontend configuration

No additional changes are required before deployment.
