# Redundant Files Analysis

The following files can be safely deleted from the project:

1. `private-data/download-pet-images.sh`
   - This file is redundant as there is an identical script in `scripts/download-pet-images.sh`
   - The script in the `scripts` directory is properly referenced in package.json and is the primary version
   - The private-data directory version appears to be an unused duplicate

2. `aws-cognito-web-identity-federation-cdk.d.ts` and `aws-cognito-web-identity-federation-cdk.js` in `bin` directory
   - These are TypeScript compilation output files
   - They are automatically generated from the .ts source files
   - These files should be added to .gitignore rather than tracked in version control

3. `aws-cognito-web-identity-federation-cdk-stack.d.ts` and `aws-cognito-web-identity-federation-cdk-stack.js` in `lib` directory
   - Similar to above, these are TypeScript compilation output files
   - They are automatically generated from the .ts source files
   - These files should be added to .gitignore rather than tracked in version control

4. `debug.js` in `frontend/src`
   - This appears to be a development-only file
   - Should be moved to a development tools directory if needed, or removed if not actively used

Note: Before deleting any files, ensure:
1. The TypeScript compilation process is working correctly
2. The build scripts are updated to reference the correct paths
3. The .gitignore file is updated to exclude compiled JavaScript files
4. Any dependent processes are updated to use the correct file paths

## Recommended Actions:
1. Delete the duplicate `download-pet-images.sh` from private-data directory
2. Update .gitignore to exclude *.js and *.d.ts files in bin and lib directories
3. Remove the compiled JavaScript and declaration files
4. Review and remove debug.js if not needed for development
